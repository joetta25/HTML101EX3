            <li>I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in three is cool</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>When you make a list, do it in this order:</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
            <ol>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items</ol>
